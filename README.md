## ‚ú® About The Project

U-Tube AI is a multi-modal AI agent that transforms YouTube videos into rich, actionable knowledge assets. Unlike traditional tools that rely solely on a video's transcript, U-Tube AI analyzes **both the audio and the visual stream**. It reads slides, understands diagrams, and captures code on screen, fusing what's said with what's shown to create notes that are incredibly detailed, accurate, and truly comprehensive.

This system is perfect for students, researchers, and professionals who need to efficiently digest complex tutorials, technical presentations, or academic lectures without losing critical visual context.

## üß† Key Features

### 1. True Visual Comprehension: Seeing What Others Miss
My core innovation is a pipeline that treats the video's visual stream as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought. It uses **adaptive frame sampling** to intelligently pinpoint key visual moments‚Äîlike slides, diagrams, or code on screen‚Äîand employs **OCR** to extract this critical information. This captures the essential context that purely transcript-based systems are blind to.

### 2. Intelligent Dual-Model Synthesis
This isn't a brute-force approach. The system uses a nimble, cost-effective model (**Gemini-Flash**) to rapidly map the video's entire topic structure and create an outline. Then, a high-power, creative model (**Gemini-Pro**) performs a "deep dive" on each section, expertly synthesizing the spoken transcript and the extracted visual data into a single, coherent narrative.

### 3. Purpose-Built RAG for Deep Note Generation
I intentionally chose **ChromaDB** over speed-focused alternatives like FAISS. Why? Because generating high-quality notes requires more than just fast vector search‚Äîit demands a seamless RAG pipeline that preserves rich metadata and context. This choice is fundamental to the system's ability to assemble complex, structured documents rather than just answering simple questions.

### 4. From Raw Video to Actionable Knowledge
The final output isn't just a summary; it's a **synthesized knowledge asset**. By fusing what's said with what's shown, the system produces incredibly rich and reliable notes. This multi-modal understanding is then delivered in user-friendly formats like **Markdown**, **Word**, and **PDF**.
